Data assimilation has become a crucial technique aiming to combine physical models with observational data to estimate state variables. Traditional assimilation algorithms often face challenges of high nonlinearity brought by both the physical and observational models. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven assimilation algorithm based on generative models to address such concerns. Our State-Observation Augmented Diffusion (SOAD) model is designed to handle nonlinear physical and observational models more effectively. The marginal posterior associated with SOAD has been derived and then proved to match the real posterior under mild assumptions, which shows theoretical superiority over previous score-based assimilation works. Experimental results also indicate that our SOAD model may offer improved accuracy over existing data-driven methods.
